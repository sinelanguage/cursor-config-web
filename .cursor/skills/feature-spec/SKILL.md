# Feature Spec

Create a concise product and technical specification for a requested feature.

## When to Use

## Instructions

1. Summarize the goal in 1-2 sentences.
2. List assumptions and out-of-scope items.
3. Define acceptance criteria as bullet points.
4. Propose a minimal implementation plan (3-7 steps).
5. List a test plan (unit, integration, E2E where relevant).
6. Call out risks or dependencies.

## Output

- A spec section with goals, acceptance criteria, plan, and test plan.
